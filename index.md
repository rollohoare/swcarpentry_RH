Skiing
-------------------
The principle componenet for skiing is a pair of skis. These are effectively two planks that you bind in some way to your feet. Most skiing is done on snow (however there is such a thing as water skiing), and can mostly be split into downhill and cross country skiing.

Cross Country skiing
--------------------
Sometimes refered to as Nordic Skiing, this is usually done on flat ground. However, it can be done on slightly inclined sections of mountain.
